Happiness is not a destination. It is a method of life
There are so many beautiful reasons to be happy!
Be happy... not because everything is good but because you can see the good in everything
It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness to dream
HAPPYNESS is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony
The future belongs to those, who believe in beauty of their dreams
It doesn't matter how slow you go, so long as you do not stop
I never dreamed about success. I worked for it
Every day is a new chance
The best is yet to come
Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you will get
People wait all week for Friday, all year for summer, all life for happiness
Every day can not be good, but there is something good in every day
Do what makes you happy. Be with who makes you smile. Laugh as much as you breathe. Love as long as you live
